# C Convention Refactoring Summary

This refactoring follows proper C programming conventions by separating headers from implementations and creating proper compilation units.

## Structure Before:
- `mlp.h` - Mixed prototypes and implementations
- `data.h` - Mixed prototypes and implementations  
- `mlp.c` - Main training program
- `gpu/mlp.h` - Mixed prototypes and implementations
- `gpu/mlp.c` - Main GPU training program

## Structure After:
### CPU Version:
- `mlp.h` - Only prototypes, structs, and includes
- `mlp.c` - MLP function implementations
- `data.h` - Only prototypes and definitions
- `data.c` - Data function implementations
- `train.c` - Main training program
- `Makefile` - Compiles separate object files and links

### GPU Version:
- `gpu/mlp.h` - Only prototypes, structs, CUDA macros, and includes
- `gpu/mlp.c` - GPU MLP function implementations
- `gpu/train.c` - Main GPU training program (uses ../data.h)
- `gpu/Makefile` - Compiles separate object files and links

## Benefits:
1. Follows C conventions with proper header/implementation separation
2. Enables separate compilation units
3. Better code organization and maintainability
4. Faster incremental builds
5. More modular design

## Compatibility:
- Old `mlp.out` target still works for compatibility
- Both `train.out` and `mlp.out` are generated
- Maintains all original functionality
